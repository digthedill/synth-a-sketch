### Synth a sketch

Disclaimer: This is a work in progress.

I wanted to make an interactive app that used socket.io. The p5 library is quite expansive, but also difficult to work with (when you're use to frontend framework.)

The idea is that two or more users can log on and sketch designs collaboratively. Obviously this is not a super functional app enviornment for true creators. This was made more as practice and should be seen as something fun.

### Tech stack

1. Node/Express
2. p5
3. socket.io
4. querystring parser
5. HTML/CSS/JS

### Longterm

It would be nice to collaborate with someone who knows more about p5. I'd like to expand the audio side of the project.
